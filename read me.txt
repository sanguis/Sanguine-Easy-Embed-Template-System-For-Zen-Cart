The Sanguine Easy embed template for Zen Cart. If this mod makes you money please consider donating to josh@sanguisdevelopment.com, via Pay Pal in order to offset the time loss that happens in the maintaining and supporting of this mod.
Notice that the style sheet here is from the site I set up with this mod (all though I have made it a little more neutral. If you want a fresh sheet consider over writing it with the style sheet from the template_default.

I.) ________________________INSTALL RQUIRMENTS _________________________
	A Zen Cart 1.3.x install
	A a working mark up file (html layout) that you would like to embed your Zen cart into.
	Basic php and html syntax knowledge.
	A willingness to worth through any issues and learn.
II.) ________________________INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS _________________________
________________________Orginalnaly Provided by Urbanx at_________________
http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showpost.php?p=456075&postcount=83

	1. create an html file in your website that you would like to embed zen cart into. let's call it shop.html and let's put it in the root of our website:
	- we can access this file from http://www.foo.com/shop.html
	- the file is found on the server at /path_to_your_files/shop.html

	2. somewhere in your html file, you need to put three very specific lines of text. WHERE you put them is up to you, but they must be together and they must be exact. the thing to know is that it goes in the body of the file, and that it goes where you want your zencart to go.

	<div id="content">
	<!-- START EMBED -->
	<!-- END EMBED -->

	3. install zen cart. i'm going to assume that you installed zen cart in a directory called zen. go to http://www.foo.com/zen and do all the zen installation stuff.

	DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER UNTIL YOU HAVE ZEN WORKING PROPERLY WITH THE DEFAULT TEMPLATE.

	4. once you have zen up and running, it is time to install the new template. the sang_embed template installs like any other template. please see the wiki if you need basic assistance with installing a template in zen cart (or better yet, buy the zen book, you won't regret it). essentially, you copy the template files to your webserver. most will go in zen/includes/templates/sang_embed, but the main thing is to match the folder structure in the download. don't forget to "turn on" the sang_embed template in the admin.

	5. make ONE change in the file named embed_config.php. you can find it at /path_to_your_files/zen/includes/templates/sang_embed/common/embed_config.php

	find the line that begins with $zc_temp (it is line 11) and change it so that it refers to the html file you created in step 1. in our example, it would be:

	$zc_temp = '/path_to_your_files/shop.html';

	THIS IS THE KEY. IT TELLS ZEN CART THAT IT MUST EMBED ITSELF IN THAT FILE.

	6. go test it by going to http://www.foo.com/zen

	7. revel in your brilliance.
	
III.)_____________________________________Road Map to version 2.______________________________
	Possible web interface in admin section.
	Liquid layout
	Embed Side boxes any where.
	Add ezpages menu

		Updated readme file to include install requirements, and support locations.
		Split divided the config file in to two files. to separate the configuration form the process.

		the script.
		Added examples to the embed_config.php
		html_header. now gets the embed_magic.php instead of the config.

		Updated readme file to include urbanix's install instructions.
	in1.1 
		tpl_footer.php and tpl_html_header.php removed body includes moved to tpl_main_page.php
		Added language files and folders that I find I am always having to change, and make copies of.
		Added a tpl_products_info.page that works more w/ the provided style sheet. in html_header.php.
		On line 18 replaced "require_once 'embed_config.php';" with require_once($template->get_template_dir('embed_config.php',DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'common'). '/embed_config.php'); to make it more over rides compliant
