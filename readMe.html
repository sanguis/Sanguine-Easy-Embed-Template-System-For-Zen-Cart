		<li class="chapterTitle" id="req">INSTALL REQUIREMENTS</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A Zen Cart 1.3.x install</li>
			<li>A a working mark up file (html layout) that you would like to embed your Zen cart into.</li>
			<li>Basic php and html syntax knowledge.</li>
			<li>A willingness to worth through any issues and learn.</li>
		</ul>
		<li class="chapterTitle" id="instructions">INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS</li>
		(Originally Provided by Urbanx <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showpost.php?p=456075&amp;postcount=83">here</a>.
		<ol>
			<li>Create an html file in your web site that you would like to embed Zen cart into. Let's call it shop.html and let's put it in the root of our web site: - we can access this file from http://www.foo.com/shop.html - the file is found on the server at /path_to_your_files/shop.html</li>
			<li>Some Where in your html file, you need to put three very specific lines of text. WHERE you put them is up to you, but they must be together and they must be exact. The thing to know is that it goes in the body of the file, and that it goes where you want your Zen Cart to go.
				<br />
				<code>
					&#60;!-- START EMBED --&#62;<br />
	     			&#60;!-- END EMBED --&#62;
				</code>
	 		</li>
			<li><p>Install Zen Cart. I'm going to assume that you installed Zen Cart in a directory called Zen. Go to http://www.foo.com/Zen and do all the Zen installation stuff.</p>
				<p><strong>DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER UNTIL YOU HAVE ZEN WORKING PROPERLY WITH THE DEFAULT TEMPLATE.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li>Once you have Zen Cart up and running, it is time to install the new template. The sang_embed template installs like any other template. Please see the wiki if you need basic assistance with installing a template in Zen Cart. Essentially, you copy the template files to your web server. Most will go in Zen/includes/templates/sang_embed, but the main thing is to match the folder structure in the download. Don't forget to "turn on" the sang_embed template in the admin.</li>
			<li>Make ONE change in the file named easy_embed/config.php. You
		    can find it at
		    /path_to_your_files/Zen/includes/templates/sang_embed/sang_embed/config.php
		    find the line that begins with "$this-&gt;templateFile" (it is
		    line 15) and change it so that it refers to the html file you
		    created in step 1. In our example, it would be:
		    $this-&gt;templateFile = '/path_to_your_files/shop.html'; Other
		    examples can be: //if your mark up file is located in the same
		    folder as this file. $this-&gt;templateFile = DIR_FS_CATALOG .
		    DIR_WS_TEMPLATES. 'sang_embed/common/' . 'FILENAME'; //if your
		    mark up file is located in the Zen Cart root.
		    $this-&gt;templateFile = DIR_FS_CATALOG . 'FILENAME'; //other
		    wise fill this in $this-&gt;templateFile =
		    'YOUR_MARKUP_FILE_WITH_THE_FULL_PATH'; THIS IS THE KEY. IT
		    TELLS ZEN CART THAT IT MUST EMBED ITSELF IN THAT FILE. </li>
			<li>(optional) in the config file there are options on lines 21-28
		    the top 4 are true or false and have been set already for Zen
		    cart and SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED. How ever if you want to add a
		    modifier to your links and images so that they point to the
		    correct files add a value there. An example would be if your
		    template was based on files that existed in the html root dir
		    you links would point to "/PAGE.html", and your Zen Cart is
		    installed in /Zen then you would want to rewrite you links to
		    be "../" so that they pointed to a parent directory. </li>
			<li>Go test it by going to http://www.foo.com/Zen 8. Revel in your brilliance.</li>

		<li class="chapterTitle" id="map">Road Map to version 3</li>.

    interface in admin section. Liquid layout Embed Side boxes any
    where.</li>
